# About This Research

**TernQED** explores how reductions in latency create value in electronic markets.

## The Core Question

Latency—the delay between when market information is generated and when it arrives at a participant—acts as friction on coordination. The market's state arrives **late and unevenly** across participants, driving safety buffers (spreads, inventory limits, hedging, margin) and races to synchronize.

But **how much value** does reducing this friction actually create? And **who captures it**?

## Six Mechanisms

This research maps latency's effects through six fundamental mechanisms:

1. **Adverse Selection Reduction** - Faster quote updates reduce toxic fills
2. **Inventory Risk Reduction** - Quicker reactions lower position risk
3. **Coordination Cost Reduction** - Tighter synchronization requires smaller buffers
4. **Arbitrage Capture** - Speed advantages capture price dislocations
5. **Information Asymmetry Exploitation** - Earlier signals enable informed trading
6. **Queue Priority Capture** - Faster submission wins queue position

## Why Equities + Crypto?

We focus on **equities and crypto** because their contrasting structures separate what is fundamental versus institutional:

- **Equities:** Regulated, centralized, sub-microsecond competition
- **Crypto:** Unregulated, fragmented, millisecond competition

Same physics, different constraints. This contrast reveals which effects are universal.

## Evidence Standard

Everything published here must be **auditable**:

- Claims traceable to sources
- Confidence labels on all assertions
- Falsification paths provided
- Corrections when wrong

This site is built with an **evidence gate**—an automated system that blocks publication of unsupported claims.

## Built With AI Agents

TernQED uses AI agents for:
- Research aggregation (Monday automation)
- Writing assistance (interactive helper)
- Claim verification (evidence gate)
- Content finalization (Friday automation)

**Human-AI collaboration:** AI handles research and verification. Humans handle synthesis and insight.

## Open Questions

This is ongoing research. Key open questions:
- How do we quantify latency value across different strategies?
- What is the optimal latency-jitter tradeoff?
- How do welfare effects differ across market structures?
- Can we predict latency value from first principles?
