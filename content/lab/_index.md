## What This Is

This is our research notebook—documenting questions we're exploring, papers we're reading, hypotheses we're testing, and insights we're developing.

**Not polished analyses.** Just honest documentation of the research process.

## The Process

**Every week:**
1. Four AI specialists (market microstructure, information theory, HFT, distributed systems) research their domains
2. Daily standups identify cross-domain patterns
3. We document questions, findings, and next steps here

**Updates posted:** Weekly (Mondays)
