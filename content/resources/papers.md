# Academic Papers on Latency & Market Microstructure

Key research papers exploring how latency affects market outcomes.

---

## Foundational Papers

### [The High-Frequency Trading Arms Race](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/eric.budish/research/HFT-FrequentBatchAuctions.pdf)
**Budish, Cramton, Shim (2015)** - Quarterly Journal of Economics

Shows how speed competition creates socially wasteful arms race. Proposes frequent batch auctions as alternative.

**Key finding:** 1 microsecond advantage → $75,000/year profit for single symbol
**Mechanism:** Queue priority capture

---

### [The Flash Crash: High-Frequency Trading in an Electronic Market](https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@economicanalysis/documents/file/oce_flashcrash0314.pdf)
**CFTC-SEC Report (2010)**

Analysis of May 6, 2010 flash crash. Shows how latency differences amplified volatility.

**Key finding:** HFT withdrawal during stress → liquidity evaporation
**Mechanism:** Adverse selection + inventory risk

---

### [Latency and Liquidity Risk](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2658091)
**Brogaard, Hendershott, Riordan (2014)**

Examines relationship between latency and liquidity provision.

**Key finding:** Lower latency → tighter spreads but also faster withdrawal during stress
**Mechanism:** Inventory risk reduction

---

## Crypto-Specific Research

### [Latency Arbitrage in Decentralized Exchanges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07639)
**Qin, Zhou, Livshits, Gervais (2021)**

First systematic study of MEV (maximal extractable value) in Ethereum DeFi.

**Key finding:** $540M+ extracted via latency arbitrage in 2 years
**Mechanism:** Arbitrage capture via transaction ordering

---

### [High-Frequency Trading on Decentralized On-Chain Exchanges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11511)
**Zhou, Qin, Gervais (2021)**

Analyzes DEX trading patterns and latency effects.

**Key finding:** 13.5ms latency advantage enables profitable arbitrage
**Mechanism:** Cross-venue arbitrage + MEV

---

## Queue Priority & Market Design

### [The Race for Speed in High-Frequency Trading](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2331613)
**Aquilina, Budish, O'Neill (2020)**

UK market data showing queue priority races.

**Key finding:** Cancellation speed as important as submission speed
**Mechanism:** Queue priority + adverse selection avoidance
