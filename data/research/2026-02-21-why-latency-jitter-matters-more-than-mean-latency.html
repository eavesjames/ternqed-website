    <h2>Synthesis Suggestions</h2>
    <p>["The Predictability Premium: Focus on how traders value latency consistency over raw speed, using the 2x premium for jitter reduction as the hook. Explore why a 2ms system with low variance beats a 1ms system with high variance - the economic mechanisms behind predictability premiums in electronic trading. This angle differentiates from typical 'speed arms race' narratives by focusing on reliability over raw performance.", 'Tail Risk in Microseconds: Center the piece around how P99 latency and jitter create asymmetric risks during volatile periods - when trading profits are highest but also when latency variance is most costly. Use the volatility arbitrage examples to show how milliseconds of unpredictability can eliminate entire trading strategies. This connects latency infrastructure to fundamental market risk management.', 'The Coordination Cost Revolution: Examine how latency jitter affects market coordination mechanisms differently in crypto vs equity markets. In fragmented crypto markets, jitter kills cross-venue arbitrage; in centralized equity markets, it affects queue priority. This structural difference explains why crypto traders pay premiums for jitter reduction while equity traders focus more on raw speed for queue position.']</p>
